# Churn-Prediction-
For any company it is key to attract new customers and at the same time avoid contract terminations to grow their revenue generating base. 
Looking at churn, different reasons trigger customers to terminate their contracts, for example better price offers, more interesting packages, bad service experiences or change of customersâ€™ personal situations.

Churn analytics provides valuable capabilities to predict customer churn and also define the underlying reasons that drive it. The churn metric is mostly shown as the percentage of customers that cancel a product or service within a given period (mostly months).

Majorly companies apply machine learning models to predict churn on an individual customer basis and take counter measures such as discounts, special offers or other gratifications to keep their customers. A customer churn analysis is a typical classification problem within the domain of supervised learning.

In this example, a basic machine learning pipeline based on a sample data set from Kaggle is build and performance of different model types is compared. The pipeline used for this example consists of 8 steps:

Step 1: Problem Definition

Step 2: Data Collection

Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Step 4: Feature Engineering

Step 5: Train/Test Split

Step 6: Model Evaluation Metrics Definition

Step 7: Model Selection, Training, Prediction and Assessment

Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning/Model Improvement
